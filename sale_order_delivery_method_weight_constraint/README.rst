==============================================
Sale Order Delivery method's weight regulation
==============================================

This module adds a functionality to show those delivery methods which are
allowed by total delivery weight. Sale order lines' products' weights are
added together and compared to Delivery method's maximum and minimum weights.
If the weight is greater than Delivery method's maximum weight or less than
minimum weight, then that Delivery method cannot be used on Sale order.
